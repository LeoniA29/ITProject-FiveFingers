# Project Background
### Description
Our client is Professor Leon Sterlin, a professor at the University of Melbourne. He requested a CRUD interface web application that would allow him to create records of artefacts, read it in various different format and styles and edit or delete existing artefacts. The application would be primarily used to store photos of family artefacts. He requested the application be able to be used both on mobile and desktop devices so he's able to show said artefact records to his families.

This gave us the following requirements:
