## About The Project

### Description
Sterling Family Artefact, a project by Group 098 (Five Fingers) of University of Melbourne's COMP30022 IT Project, is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface web application to store photos of our client's family artefacts. Sterling Family Artefact offers a personalised experience for our client, developed with robustness in mind, and shared in DNA many similarities with our client’s site – from the colour scheme to the font usage. This application enables users to create records of artefacts, read it in various different formats and styles, edit and delete existing artefacts, and is compatible on both mobile and desktop devices to conveniently show artefact records to the user's friends and family anytime, anywhere.

This gave us the following requirements:
